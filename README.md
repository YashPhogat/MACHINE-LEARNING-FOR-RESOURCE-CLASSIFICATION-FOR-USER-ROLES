# MACHINE-LEARNING-FOR-RESOURCE-CLASSIFICATION-FOR-USER-ROLES

Achieved ~89% classification accuracy in Machine Learning classification problem to decide whether a resource is allocated to a specific user role or not.


User Role were defined by features of the employee like department, position, job profile etc.


Conducted thorough data analysis; Linear classification algorithms were applied, and feature selection was attempted along with data normalization techniques such as Boosting, Bagging, Encoding etc.


Executed Ensemble classification algorithms using Random Forest, SVM algorithms, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees.

The following repository contains the Problem Data, the research readings, the final report and the Final R - language code of the problem.
It also contains the result AUC curves for different algorithms.
